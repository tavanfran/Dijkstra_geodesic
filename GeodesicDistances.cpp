//+PLUMEDOC ANALYSIS GEODESIC_DISTANCES
/*
 Calculate the geodesic distances between data points (nodes) using Djkstra's algorithm, which finds the shortest path between configurations. In few words, the Dijkstra's algorithm takes the first node as starting point and search for the neighbors node the one with the lowest distance. When found, the first node (start) and the new node (second) are marked as processed and the distance between the nodes is stored in a variable representing the total length of the oath. Then, the distances between the second node and its neighbors are calculated and the node with the minumum distance is marked as processed (third node). The distance between the second and the third node is added to the total path lenght. Again from the new node (third), algorithm search for the smaller distance between the neighbors until all nodes have been processed, meaning that a path connecting the first and the last configuration has been obtained. For more information, please read the relative Wikipedia page.
 
 GEODESIC_DISTANCES calculates the matrix of geodesic distances between a trajectory of atomic configurations.
 Three CVs describing the system are required.
 
 The geodesic distance matrix gives an indication of the distances between two configurations in order to characterize the
 pathways of conformational changes of the system.
 
 Geodesic distances preserve the dynamics proximity in the low dimension.
 
 The geodesic distances could be calculated using two methods:
 - the neighbors method (NEIGHBORS): the distances between neighbors are computed and sorted in ascending order to introduce an order parameter. The first NEIGHBORS neighbors are connected.
 - the epsilon method (EPSILON): the epsilon value to be used as a cut-off distance between pairs should be passed and all pairs with a distance less than this value are computed.
 
 Compulsory keywords:
 CUTOFF = this is the cutoff used in the Dijkstra's algorithm. If greater than 0 the keyword MAXCONNECT must be used, otherwise NEIGHBORS.
 Optional:
 MAXCONNECT = maximum number of connections that can be formed by any given node in the graph if you are using CUTOFF.
 NEIGHBORS = the number of neighbors to use when constructing the graph that will be used when we run Djkstra's algorithm. This number should be smaller than the half of the total number of nodes. GEODESIC_DISTANCES will tell if the choice of the value is appropriate or not.
 
 
 The values obtained from the methods above are passed to the Dijkstra's algorithm that computes the the shortest
 paths between configurations.
 
 BEWARE: some configurations should be not connected each other, so the choice of NEIGHBORS and EPSILON must be done with accuracy.
 
 ERROR CODES:
 1: Your MAXCONNECT value is equal or lower than 0 and this has no physical meaning. Change the value to a positive value
 2: The value entered for NEIGHBORS is not an integer
 
 
 \par Examples
 
 The following input tells plumed to perform the GEODESIC_DISTANCES on the EUCLIDEAN_DISSIMILARITIES and
 to use CLASSICAL_MDS. This routine must be used in conjungtion with EUCLIDEAN_DISSIMILARITIES and with CLASSICAL_MDS routines.
